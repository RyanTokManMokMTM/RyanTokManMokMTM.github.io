## TODO && Description
In the previous version, a user could only view their friend's story and reply to the story. It can't have any interaction with their friends except replying to the story, so in this version, I planned to add more interaction features to it.


There are three main features I have updated. The first is that the story can be liked; the second is that the story owner can view who sees the story and be able to send a message to the viewer; and the last thing is to share a story with any friend. All these features are not difficult to implement, so I have nothing to share with you about tech issues.


In this article, it is just a simple record of what I have updated in this version.


Hope you have a good day. Enjoy!
