<video src="/videos/chat-app/story-update.mp4" controls="controls" width="500"></video>   
What i have done for this feature?  
* Allowed user to add `text` or `image` to his story.
* For making story editor more flexible, added a `item alignment system` and `item scaling`, `rotation` and `movable`.
* Baisc attribute for the item, for example: Text - (text color, bold,background etc), image(border)
* Allowed friends to like the story by pressing the like button.
