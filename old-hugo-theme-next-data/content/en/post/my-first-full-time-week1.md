## Introducation

Today is my full-time job as a software engineer. I have been working for one week. So this post is going to share my feeling about my first full-time job this week.   
Before I jump into the topic, I want to share my interview experience with this company and the company in the Financial technology industry that works on blockchain technology and Web3. In the interview process, I needed to finish a  written examination about basic programming within 45mins. After I finished it, I had to interview the manager and the manager asked about my experience during my college and introduced what are the company working on, that's all, he didn't ask me about some technical problem or algorithm, that wasn't what I expected in an interview, haha.  
Then, one week later, I got an offer of this job in this company.

## Working 
During this working week, I have done nothing rather than learn about blockchain and study their previous project. While I studied their project, I spent a lot of time building up the project environment. Let's share what was I struggle with in those projects.  

The first project is a front-end project which is using NextJS to develop. When I tried to run in the development mode, it couldn't load all the static resources such as image, javascript, and CSS, but this problem was just happening in the Window system. If I try to run in docker or Macos environment, all the resources can load successfully. But I didn't know why before backend tech told me the reason, it was caused by the path being different between macOS/Linux. Something like that: `win: \xxx\yyy\ddd` and `/xxx/yyy/ddd`  

The second project is a backened project which is using Kotlin/Java and Spring-boot framework. I have't leanrned Kotlin/Java and Spring before, so i need to spend time in setting up the enviroment. It wasn't the biggest challenge i was facing on, the main challenge was when i tried to run any server-applicated that was inside the project, it always failed due to SQL-Connection problem, but the sql connection was already connected. It was so weird. After i done some experiment, I found out the resson caused the problem, was the scheme's character-set wan't set to UTF-8. damn it,haha.

## Summary
I think working in a small company is not such bad think that i through, all the people who are wokring here are really nice and feel free to communicate with them. ^^

In the future, if i get much more feeling about working, i will be share here again!
