### 簡介
The main purpose of developing this application is to address the problem of searching for OTT resources, movie content, and discussions across different platforms, such as the issues of invalid or illegal OTT resources and the time spent searching for these resources. Therefore, this application has two main components: movie OTT resource integration and a movie social platform.

### Main Features
* Basic user functions (login/logout/edit profile, etc.)
* Provide a vast array of movie resources for users to browse (approximately 1 million+)
* Allow users to like and bookmark movies
* Provide valid OTT resources for movies (e.g., Netflix, Disney+, YouTube TV, etc.)
* Offer a community platform for users to publish movie articles, like other users' articles, comment, and reply to comments
* Enable users to view other users' profiles (e.g., published articles, liked movies, and personal collections)
* Allow users to communicate via simple text exchanges with friends to share more information
* Share app articles on social media (e.g., Instagram)
